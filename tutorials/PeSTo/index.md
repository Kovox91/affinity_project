# Tutorial: PeSTo

PeSTo is a project for **predicting protein interaction interfaces** using a *deep learning approach*.
It processes 3D protein structures from PDB files, cleans them, and then converts them into *numerical features* suitable for machine learning.
These features are stored in an HDF5 dataset. A **configurable PyTorch neural network** is trained on this dataset to identify patterns indicative of protein binding sites.
The system includes tools for managing model configurations, and an orchestrator handles the training and evaluation workflow.
