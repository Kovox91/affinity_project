# Chapter 7: Model Configuration (`model.Model.Config`, `model_config.GlobalConfig`)

Welcome to Chapter 7! In [Chapter 6: Feature Representation (`features.BatchDict`, `feat_batch.Batch`)](06_feature_representation___features_batchdict____feat_batch_batch___.md), we learned how AlphaFold 3 organizes all the input data (sequences, MSAs, templates) into a structured numerical format called `feat_batch.Batch` – the "ingredient tray" for our AI model.

Now that we have the ingredients prepped, how do we tell the "master chef" (the AlphaFold 3 neural network) *how* to cook? How many layers should the network have? What specific techniques should it use? This is where Model Configuration comes in.

## What's the Big Deal About Model Configuration?

Imagine our AlphaFold 3 neural network is an incredibly complex piece of machinery, like a futuristic car factory. This factory can build amazing molecular structures. The **Model Configuration** objects, specifically `model.Model.Config` and `model_config.GlobalConfig`, are like the **master control panels** for this factory.

These control panels define all the settings and blueprints for the neural network:
*   **Architectural Choices**: How many layers should the main processing unit (the [Evoformer Network (`evoformer_network.Evoformer`)](08_evoformer_network___evoformer_network_evoformer___.md)) have? What should be the size of internal data representations (embedding dimensions)?
*   **Hyperparameters**: These are crucial numbers that tune the learning process and network behavior. For example, which specific type of attention mechanism to use, or settings for the [Diffusion Model (`diffusion_head.DiffusionHead`)](09_diffusion_model___diffusion_head_diffusionhead___.md).
*   **Global Settings**: Some settings apply across many parts of the model, like whether to use a specific type of numerical precision (e.g., bfloat16) to speed up calculations.

Essentially, these configuration objects tell AlphaFold 3:
1.  **What components to build** for the neural network.
2.  **How each component should be built** (its specific settings).
3.  **How the overall process should run** (e.g., number of refinement cycles).

Without these configurations, the AlphaFold 3 model wouldn't know its own structure or how to operate. They allow researchers to experiment with different model setups and give users control over certain aspects of the model's behavior during prediction.

## The Two Main Configuration Hubs

AlphaFold 3 uses a hierarchical system for configuration, but two key players are:

1.  **`model.Model.Config` (from `alphafold3/model/model.py`)**:
    *   This is the **main configuration for the entire AlphaFold 3 `Model`**.
    *   It's like the main dashboard for the whole factory.
    *   It holds settings for the overall model, like the number of "recycling" steps (refinement iterations).
    *   Crucially, it also contains *other, more specific configuration objects* for different parts of the model. For example, it will have a section for configuring the Evoformer, another for the structure prediction heads, and so on.

2.  **`model_config.GlobalConfig` (from `alphafold3/model/model_config.py`)**:
    *   This object holds settings that are **globally relevant to many different parts of the neural network**.
    *   Think of this as the factory's "standard operating procedures" manual – rules that everyone follows.
    *   Examples include settings for numerical precision (like using `bfloat16` for faster math), or default ways to initialize parts of the network.
    *   The `model.Model.Config` will contain an instance of `GlobalConfig`.

## How Configurations Are Used: A Simple Example

You usually don't create these configuration objects from scratch every time. AlphaFold 3 provides default configurations. The `run_alphafold.py` script, for example, starts with these defaults and then might tweak a few settings based on the command-line flags you provide.

Let's look at a simplified conceptual example of how `run_alphafold.py` might prepare a model configuration:

```python
# This is a conceptual, simplified example
# Actual code is in run_alphafold.py and alphafold3/model/model.py

from alphafold3.model import model # For model.Model.Config
# from alphafold3.model import model_config # For model_config.GlobalConfig
# from alphafold3.jax.attention import attention # For attention.Implementation

# --- This function is similar to `make_model_config` in `run_alphafold.py` ---
def get_my_model_configuration(
    num_recycles_to_run: int,
    num_samples_for_diffusion: int,
    use_fast_attention: bool
):
    # 1. Start with a default Model.Config
    # This automatically creates default sub-configs too!
    main_config = model.Model.Config()

    # 2. Modify specific settings based on user preferences
    main_config.num_recycles = num_recycles_to_run
    main_config.heads.diffusion.eval.num_samples = num_samples_for_diffusion
    
    # 3. Modify settings within the GlobalConfig (which is part of main_config)
    if use_fast_attention:
        main_config.global_config.flash_attention_implementation = "triton" # A fast type
    else:
        main_config.global_config.flash_attention_implementation = "xla"   # A more basic type

    return main_config

# Let's get a configuration:
my_settings = get_my_model_configuration(
    num_recycles_to_run=10,
    num_samples_for_diffusion=5,
    use_fast_attention=True
)

# Now, my_settings is a model.Model.Config object ready to be passed
# to the AlphaFold 3 Model when it's created.
# print(f"Number of recycles: {my_settings.num_recycles}")
# print(f"Flash attention: {my_settings.global_config.flash_attention_implementation}")
```

When you run this conceptual code:
1.  `model.Model.Config()` creates a configuration object with all default values for the main model and its sub-components (like the Evoformer, diffusion head, and the `GlobalConfig`).
2.  We then override specific values. For example, `main_config.num_recycles` is set directly.
3.  Notice how we access nested configurations: `main_config.heads.diffusion.eval.num_samples`. This means the `main_config` has a `heads` config, which has a `diffusion` config, which has an `eval` config, which finally has the `num_samples` setting.
4.  The `main_config.global_config.flash_attention_implementation` shows how we access and modify the `GlobalConfig` that's part of the main model configuration.

This `my_settings` object would then be passed to the AlphaFold 3 `Model` when it's initialized, telling it exactly how to build itself and operate.

If you were to print some values, you'd see:
```
Number of recycles: 10
Flash attention: triton
```

## Under the Hood: Dataclasses and `BaseConfig`

These configuration objects (like `model.Model.Config`, `model_config.GlobalConfig`, and all their nested counterparts like `Evoformer.Config`) are typically Python **dataclasses**. Dataclasses are a convenient way to create classes that primarily store data (our settings).

Many of these configuration classes in AlphaFold 3 inherit from a common class called `BaseConfig` (found in `alphafold3/common/base_config.py`). This `BaseConfig` provides some helpful features. One notable feature is `autocreate`.

```python
# Simplified structure of Model.Config from alphafold3/model/model.py
# from alphafold3.common import base_config
# from alphafold3.model import model_config
# from alphafold3.model.network import evoformer as evoformer_network
# # ... other imports for head configs ...

# class Model(hk.Module): # This is the main neural network class
#   class HeadsConfig(base_config.BaseConfig):
#       diffusion: diffusion_head.DiffusionHead.Config = base_config.autocreate()
#       # ... other head configs
#
#   class Config(base_config.BaseConfig):
#       evoformer: evoformer_network.Evoformer.Config = base_config.autocreate()
#       global_config: model_config.GlobalConfig = base_config.autocreate()
#       heads: 'Model.HeadsConfig' = base_config.autocreate()
#       num_recycles: int = 10 # A default value
#       return_embeddings: bool = False
#       # ... other top-level settings ...
```
In this simplified snippet:
*   `Model.Config` is a dataclass inheriting from `base_config.BaseConfig`.
*   Fields like `evoformer`, `global_config`, and `heads` are themselves other configuration objects.
*   `base_config.autocreate()` is a helper. When you create an instance of `Model.Config()` without specifying, say, `evoformer`, `autocreate()` tells Python to automatically create a default `evoformer_network.Evoformer.Config()` object for you. This is why `model.Model.Config()` gives you a fully populated (with defaults) configuration tree.

**`model_config.GlobalConfig`**
This class is simpler as it usually contains direct settings rather than many nested configs.

```python
# Simplified structure of GlobalConfig from alphafold3/model/model_config.py
# from alphafold3.common import base_config
# from alphafold3.jax.attention import attention # For attention.Implementation type
# from typing import Literal

# class GlobalConfig(base_config.BaseConfig):
#   bfloat16: Literal['all', 'none', 'intermediate'] = 'all' # Use bfloat16 precision
#   final_init: Literal['zeros', 'linear'] = 'zeros' # How to initialize some layers
#   flash_attention_implementation: attention.Implementation = 'triton' # Default attention
#   # ... other global settings ...
```
This `GlobalConfig` will be a part of `Model.Config` (via `main_config.global_config`).

## How Configurations Flow

Here's how these configurations generally fit into the AlphaFold 3 system:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as "User / run_alphafold.py"
    participant ModelConfig as "Model.Config"
    participant GlobalConf as "GlobalConfig"
    participant EvoConf as "Evoformer.Config"
    participant DiffConf as "DiffusionHead.Config"
    participant AF3Model as "AlphaFold 3 Model"
    participant EvoNet as "Evoformer Network"
    participant DiffHead as "Diffusion Head"

    User->>ModelConfig: Creates/modifies (e.g., via make_model_config)
    Note over ModelConfig: Contains GlobalConfig, Evoformer.Config, HeadsConfig (with DiffusionHead.Config) etc.
    ModelConfig-->>GlobalConf: Instantiates/holds
    ModelConfig-->>EvoConf: Instantiates/holds
    ModelConfig-->>DiffConf: Instantiates/holds (via HeadsConfig)

    User->>AF3Model: Passes ModelConfig during initialization
    AF3Model->>ModelConfig: Reads overall settings (e.g., num_recycles)
    AF3Model->>EvoNet: Passes Evoformer.Config during its initialization
    AF3Model->>DiffHead: Passes DiffusionHead.Config during its initialization
    
    Note over AF3Model, EvoNet, DiffHead: Components also access GlobalConfig (often via ModelConfig)
```

1.  When `run_alphafold.py` starts, it prepares a `model.Model.Config` object (often using a helper function like `make_model_config`). This main config object will contain instances of `GlobalConfig`, `Evoformer.Config`, various head configurations, etc., all initialized with default values or values derived from your command-line flags.
2.  This `Model.Config` object is then passed to the main `alphafold3.model.model.Model` class when it's created.
3.  The `Model` class uses the top-level settings from its config (like `num_recycles`).
4.  When the `Model` class creates its sub-components (like the [Evoformer Network (`evoformer_network.Evoformer`)](08_evoformer_network___evoformer_network_evoformer___.md) or the [Diffusion Model (`diffusion_head.DiffusionHead`)](09_diffusion_model___diffusion_head_diffusionhead___.md)), it passes the relevant sub-configuration (e.g., `model_config.evoformer` or `model_config.heads.diffusion`) to them.
5.  Each component then uses its specific configuration to set up its internal architecture and parameters. Many components will also refer to the `GlobalConfig` (usually passed down through their own config) for common settings.

This structured approach ensures that all parts of the complex AlphaFold 3 neural network are built and behave consistently according to the defined "master plan."

## Why is This Important for You?

Even if you're a beginner just using `run_alphafold.py`, understanding model configurations helps you:
*   **Understand Command-Line Flags**: Many flags in `run_alphafold.py` (like `--num_recycles`, `--num_diffusion_samples`, `--flash_attention_implementation`) directly map to settings in these configuration objects. Knowing this helps you understand what those flags *do*.
*   **Appreciate Model Complexity**: You get a sense of the many "dials and knobs" that define such a powerful AI model.
*   **Basic Customization**: While deep architectural changes are advanced, you might encounter situations where understanding how to tweak a high-level configuration parameter could be useful (e.g., for debugging or slight performance adjustments if guided).
*   **Foundation for Deeper Learning**: If you ever want to delve into the model's architecture or training code, these configuration objects are fundamental.

## Conclusion

Model Configuration objects, primarily `model.Model.Config` and the `model_config.GlobalConfig` it contains, are the blueprints and control panels for the AlphaFold 3 neural network. They define everything from the number of layers in network blocks to the type of numerical precision used.

These configurations are typically hierarchical dataclasses, allowing for organized and detailed control over every aspect of the model. They are crucial for defining the model's architecture, controlling its behavior during inference (prediction), and enabling researchers to experiment with new ideas.

We've now seen how the "ingredients" are prepared ([Chapter 6: Feature Representation (`features.BatchDict`, `feat_batch.Batch`)](06_feature_representation___features_batchdict____feat_batch_batch___.md)) and how the "recipe instructions" are set ([Chapter 7: Model Configuration (`model.Model.Config`, `model_config.GlobalConfig`)](07_model_configuration___model_model_config____model_config_globalconfig___.md)). In the next chapter, we'll start looking at one of the main "cooking stations" in the AlphaFold 3 kitchen: the [Evoformer Network (`evoformer_network.Evoformer`)](08_evoformer_network___evoformer_network_evoformer___.md), a core component that processes the input features.
